## Resources

**[Demystifying JavaScript Closures, Callbacks and IIFEs](http://www.sitepoint.com/demystifying-javascript-closures-callbacks-iifes/)**

I mainly used this site to understand callback as I found that very confusing. I watched the lynda.com video on functions and it wasn't completely clear to me how the callback worked. This site helped me understand it a bit more as the code seemed more simple.

**[Beginners: Javascript Objects and Arrays](http://www.appcelerator.com/blog/2013/04/beginners-javascript-objects-and-arrays-2/)**

This site was a nice review of objects and arrays. The code was simple which helped review the structure of objects within an array. 

**[Presidents & Vice Presidents](http://www.presidentsusa.net/presvplist.html)**

I used this site to obtain the presidents' information.

**[Quotes in Strings](http://www.javascripter.net/faq/quotesin.htm)**

Some of the strings you asked us to type had apostrophes. Since I was using single quotes throughout my JavaScript, I looked up how to add apostrophes to strings. This one references quotes but it's the same thing.

**[JavaScript Array push() Method](http://www.w3schools.com/jsref/jsref_push.asp)**

From this site, I learned how to add a value to an array after the fact. 

## Comments

This assignment definitely became difficult once I hit the functions part. Once I started to play around with it, I began to understand more but I will definitely need more practice.

I may or may not have done the branches right. Automatically, I kept going back to the master branch to have a clean .js file and would create branches off the master. I realize after the fact (as I'm typing this up and thinking about it) that the assignment didn't say to do that. It just said to create a branch after branch. Visually, it was interesting to see the branches when I would run `git long --oneline --graph --decorate --all`. This was a very small project with minimal changes but I'm sure it can get very complicated with so many branches.
